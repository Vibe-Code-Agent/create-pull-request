# Confluence Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Confluence integration for the create-pull-request tool. When generating PR descriptions, the system now automatically fetches and includes content from Confluence pages linked to Jira tickets.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Extended JiraTicket Interface
- Added `confluencePages` property to include linked Confluence page data
- Added `ConfluencePage` interface with id, title, content, and url properties

### 2. New Constants and Configuration
- Added Confluence API endpoints (`CONFLUENCE_ENDPOINTS`)
- Added content compression limits for optimal AI prompt usage:
  - `MAX_CONFLUENCE_CONTENT_LENGTH`: 2000 characters
  - `MAX_CONFLUENCE_PAGES_COUNT`: 5 pages maximum
  - `CONFLUENCE_CONTENT_SUMMARY_LENGTH`: 300 characters

### 3. Enhanced JiraService
- **`getConfluencePages(ticketKey)`**: Fetches Confluence pages linked to a Jira ticket via remote links
- **`getConfluencePageContent(pageUrl)`**: Extracts content from individual Confluence pages
- **`stripHtmlAndCompress(htmlContent)`**: Intelligent HTML stripping and content compression
- **Auto-initialization**: Confluence client automatically initialized alongside Jira client
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when Confluence is unavailable

### 4. URL Pattern Support
- Old-style Confluence URLs: `/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=123456`
- New-style Confluence URLs: `/spaces/SPACE/pages/123456/Page+Title`
- Automatic page ID extraction and content fetching

### 5. Content Processing
- HTML tag removal while preserving text content
- HTML entity decoding (e.g., `&amp;` â†’ `&`)
- Intelligent truncation at sentence boundaries
- Content compression to stay within AI token limits

### 6. AI Prompt Enhancement
- Confluence content integrated into both summary and description generation
- Clear separation of documentation sources in prompts
- Instructions for AI to validate implementation against documented requirements
- URL preservation for reviewer reference

### 7. Comprehensive Testing
- 33 new unit tests covering all Confluence functionality
- Tests for various URL formats, error conditions, and edge cases
- Mock testing for both successful and failed API responses
- Content compression and HTML processing validation

## Integration Points

### JiraService.getTicket()
Now automatically fetches linked Confluence pages and includes them in the ticket response when available.

### AI Description Generator
Both `generateSummary()` and `buildPrompt()` methods now include Confluence content in their prompts:

```
## Related Confluence Documentation:
The following Confluence pages provide important context and requirements for this ticket:

### Page Title
- URL: https://...
- Key Information: [compressed content]

CRITICAL: Use the information from these Confluence pages to:
1. Validate that the code changes align with documented requirements
2. Reference relevant specifications or design decisions
3. Ensure implementation follows established patterns
4. Include relevant context for reviewers
```

## Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when Confluence is not configured
- Warning messages for failed API calls without breaking the main flow
- Automatic retry and error recovery
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Performance Considerations
- Limited to maximum 5 Confluence pages per ticket
- Content compressed to 2000 characters maximum per page
- Intelligent sentence-boundary truncation
- Concurrent fetching where possible
- Timeout protection for API calls

## Security
- Uses existing Jira credentials for Confluence access
- Same authentication mechanism as Jira integration
- No additional credential storage required

## Usage
The integration is automatic - no user configuration required beyond existing Jira setup. When creating pull requests, if linked Confluence pages exist, they will automatically be included in the AI-generated description.

This enhancement significantly improves PR quality by ensuring AI-generated descriptions align with documented requirements and specifications.
